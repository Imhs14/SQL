/* The SQL IN Operator
The IN operator is used in the WHERE clause to check if a specified column's value matches any value within a provided list.
The IN operator functions as a shorthand for multiple OR conditions, making queries shorter and more readable.
The following SQL uses the IN operator to select all customers from Germany, France, or UK:     */
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE "Country" IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');

--- The following SQL uses multiple OR conditions to select all customers from Germany, France, or UK (same result, but longer code):
SELECT * FROM customers  WHERE "Country" = 'Germany' OR "Country" = 'France' OR "Country" = 'UK';

/* Syntax
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
*/
--- #-------------The NOT IN Opearator--------------------
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE "Country" NOT IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');

--- #------------The IN(SELECT)-----------------------
/* You can also use IN with a subquery in the WHERE clause.
With a subquery you can return all records from the main query that are present in the result of the subquery.
The following SQL returns all customers who also have an order in the "Orders" table:   */
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE "CustomerID" IN (SELECT "CustomerID" FROM orders);

/* NOT IN (SELECT)
The result in the example above returned 74 records, that means that there are 17 customers that haven't placed any orders.
Let us check if that is correct, by using the NOT IN operator.
The following SQL returns all customers who do NOT have any orders in the "Orders" table:*/

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE "CustomerID" NOT IN (SELECT "CustomerID" FROM orders); 

# IN used to specify the range of values in a where clause
